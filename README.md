### Project Overview

This is an older project, completed in **January 2024**, that is now being uploaded to GitHub. The project was a hypothetical task for a **pharmaceutical company** aimed at predicting sales based on marketing budgets. The company's marketing channels included **Instagram**, **YouTube**, and **Podcasts**.  

Using the **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** method, the budgets from all channels were summed up to create a single, consolidated marketing budget. The primary goal was to predict sales for any given **total marketing budget**, regardless of how the budget was allocated across the individual channels.  

At this stage, the project focused solely on **model development**, with no metric evaluation performed. However, subsequent projects will include both **metric evaluation** and further **model development** to enhance performance and insight.
